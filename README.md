# abibuch
A PHP web application for the organization of the abibuch. Among other things there are the following functionalites:

* Upload of a current picture and a child picture
* Uservotes, Teachervotes
* Personal information e.g. name, hobbies etc.
* short comments and long comments about other pupils
* Submission of "funny stories"

This web page was originally written 2009 for my personal Abitur-class and then extended in the following years for several other Abitur-classes. A showcase implementation can be viewed at ``http://abibuch.leifnaundorf.de``. The logins are:

normal user login: user/user

Administrator login: admin/admin
